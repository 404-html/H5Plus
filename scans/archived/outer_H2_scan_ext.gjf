!!!      This file exists to serve two purposes:                             !!!
!!!        1) to be a starting point for any new jobs                        !!!
!!!        2) to serve as a template for the GJF maker I have in the works   !!!
!!!      To the extent reasonable sections will have documentation blocks    !!!
!!!                                                                          !!!

!!      Charge and Spin Line:
!!          The first line of the molecule specification section specifies the
!!        net electric charge (a signed integer) and the spin multiplicity
!!        (usually a positive integer).
!!          Thus, for a neutral molecule in a singlet state, the entry 0 1 is
!!        appropriate.
!!        For a radical anion, -1 2 would be used.
!!        Multiple charge/spin pairs may/must be included for some calculation types.
!!        Doesn't strictly need a comment' but it's not a bad idea

1, 1 ! +1 charge in a singlet state
