abstract = {A new abundance table has been compiled, based on a critical review of all C1 chondrite analyses up to mid-1982. Where C1 data were inaccurate or lacking, data for other meteorite classes were used, but with allowance for fractionation among classes. In a number of cases, interelement ratios from meteorites or lunar and terrestrial rocks as well as solar wind were used to check and constrain abundances. A few elements were interpolated (Ar, Kr, Xe, Hg) or estimated from astronomical data (H, C, N, O, He, Ne). For most elements, the new abundances differ by less than 20{\%} from those of Cameron (1982a). In 14 cases, the change is between 20 and 50{\%} (He, Ne, Be, Br, Nb, Te, I, Xe, La, Gd, Tb, Yb, Ta and Pb) and in 5 others, it exceeds 50{\%} (B, P, Mo, W, Hg). Some important interelement ratios (NaK, SeTe, RbSr, KrXe, LaW, ThU, PbU, etc.) are significantly affected by these changes. Three tests were carried out, to see how closely C1 chondrites approximate primordial solar system abundances. (1) A plot of solar vs Cl abundances shows only 7 discrepancies by more than twice the nominal error of the solar abundance: Ga, Ge, Nb, Ag, Lu, W and Os. Most or all apparently reflect errors in the solar data or f-values. (2) The major cosmochemical groups (refractories, siderophiles, volatiles, etc.) show no significant fractionation between the Sun and C1's, except possibly for a slight enrichment of volatiles in Cl's. (3) Abundances of odd-A nuclides between A = 65 and 209 show an almost perfectly smooth trend, with elemental abundances conforming to the slope defined by isotopic abundances. There is no evidence for systematic fractionation of the major cosmochemical groups from each other. Small irregularities (10–15{\%}) show up in the Ag-Cd-In and Sm-Eu regions; the former may be due to a {\~{}} 15{\%} error in the Ag abundance and the latter, to a 10–20{\%} fractionation of Eu during condensation, to contamination of C1 chondrites with interplanetary dust during regolith exposure, or to a change from s-process to r-process dominance. It appears that the new set of abundances is accurate to at least 10{\%}, as irregularities of 5–10{\%} are readily detectable. Accordingly, Cl chondrites seem to match primordial solar-system matter to ⩽ 10{\%}, with only four exceptions. Br and I are definitely and B is possibly fractionated by hydrothermal alteration, whereas Eu seems to be enriched by nebular condensation or regolith contamination.},

abstract = {Understanding the spectroscopy and dynamics of H5(+) is central in gaining insights into the H3(+) + H2 → H5(+) → H2 + H3(+) proton transfer reaction. This molecular ion exhibits large-amplitude vibrations, which allow for the transfer of a proton between H3(+) and H2 even in its ground vibrational state. With vibrational excitation, the number of open channels for permutations of protons increase. In this work, the minimized energy path variant of diffusion Monte Carlo is used to investigate how the energetically accessible proton permutations evolve as H5(+) is dissociated into H3(+) + H2. Two mechanisms for proton permutation are investigated. The first is the proton hop, which correlates to large-amplitude vibrations of the central proton in H5(+). The second is the exchange of a pair of hydrogen atoms between H3(+) and H2. This mechanism requires several proton hops along with a 120° rotation of H3(+) within the H5(+) molecular ion. This analysis shows that while there is a narrow region of configuration space over which both isomerization processes are energetically accessible, full permutation of the five protons in H5(+) more likely occurs through a stepwise mechanism. Such full permutation of the protons becomes accessible when the shared proton stretch is excited to the vpt = 2 or 3 excited state. The effects of deuteration and rotational excitation of the H2 and H3(+) products are also investigated. Deuteration inhibits permutation of protons, while rotational excitation has only a small impact on these processes.},

abstract = {A novel discrete variable representation (DVR) is introduced for use as the L2 basis of the S‐matrix version of the Kohn variational method [Zhang, Chu, and Miller, J. Chem. Phys. 88, 6233 (1988)] for quantum reactive scattering. (It can also be readily used for quantum eigenvalue problems.) The primary novel feature is that this DVR gives an extremely simple kinetic energy matrix (the potential energy matrix is diagonal, as in all DVRs) which is in a sense ‘‘universal,'' i.e., independent of any explicit reference to an underlying set of basis functions; it can, in fact, be derived as an infinite limit using different basis functions. An energy truncation procedure allows the DVR grid points to be adapted naturally to the shape of any given potential energy surface. Application to the benchmark collinear H+H2→H2+H reaction shows that convergence in the reaction probabilities is achieved with only about 15{\%} more DVR grid points than the number of conventional basis functions used in previous S‐matrix Kohn...},

abstract = {We report experimental and calculated infrared spectra of the highly fluxional cations H 5 þ and D 5 þ. These cations have been postulated to exist in the interstellar medium and to play a central role in the deuterium fractionation. The experiments produce these ions in a pulsed discharge supersonic nozzle ion source and utilize mass-selected photodissociation spectroscopy in the 2000-4500 cm-1 region. Vibrational bands apparently broadened by rapid predissociation are detected throughout this region for both isotopologues. The calculated spectra make use of an ab initio potential energy surface and a new dipole moment surface and are based on results from fixed-node quantum diffusion Monte Carlo and variational vibrational calculations. The successful assignment of the experimental spectra requires a proper treatment of the delocalized anharmonic shared-proton mode and indicates a major breakdown of the harmonic approximation. Several calculated intense spectral features associated with this mode in the far-infrared region could guide future observational searches of these cations. SECTION Kinetics, Spectroscopy W ith the observation of H 3 þ in the interstellar medium (ISM), 1,2 aided greatly by theory, 3 the reactions of this cation and its deuterated isotopo-logues with molecular hydrogen and its deuterated isotopo-logues are believed to play central roles in the deuterium fractionation in the ISM. 4-7 Since H 5 þ and its deuterated analogues are stable species, the spectroscopic detection of these cations in the ISM should be possible and would be of primary importance. This cannot be done in the absence of laboratory-based or predictive calculated spectra. A low-resolution action spectrum 8 of H 5 þ published in 1988 reported three broad features at 3532, 3910, and 4230 cm-1. These features, especially the last one, were interpreted cautiously in view of the (correctly) suspected highly fluxional nature of the vibrations based on ab initio calculations of scaled harmonic frequencies and intensities. 9 The highly fluxional nature of the ground vibrational state of H 5 þ and all of the deuterated isotopologues has been established from recent rigorous quantum diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations 10,11 using a high-quality ab-initio-based potential energy surface (PES) that is invariant with respect to the 5! permutations of the H atoms. 10 An approximate anharmonic treatment of the vibrational modes also emphasizes the highly anharmonic character of these vibrations. 12 The combination of this highly anharmonic shared-proton mode plus the highly fluxional nature of the H 5 þ cation make exact quantum calculations of the IR spectrum unfeasible. Thus, our approach is to use state-of-the-art methods to obtain the infrared (IR) spectra of H 5 þ and D 5 þ reported here. These are compared with new and improved photodissociation spectra, which also report new bands for H 5 þ and the first spectra for D 5 þ. The calculations reported here make use of an ab initio PES 10 and a new full-dimensional dipole moment surface (DMS) that is a fit to roughly 5000 dipole moment values obtained using density functional theory data with the B3LYP functional and the aug-cc-pvtz basis using the code MOL-PRO. 13 The representation of the DMS is invariant with respect to all permutations of the H atoms. It does not assume a linear form; however, it is limited to the bound and near-dissociation regions of H 5 þ and thus does not describe the dipole of the infinitely separated fragments. The previous DMC calculations of the ground vibrational state showed a highly symmetric wave function, 11 which has maximum amplitude at the saddle point configuration (of D 2d symmetry) which is only 52 cm-1 above two equivalent minima (of C 2v symmetry). This indicates both delocalization of the wave function and the singular importance of this saddle point instead of the global minimum as the configuration of most relevance. With that in mind, we show the},

In this work, diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) approaches are used to explore the nature of vibrationally excited states of the proton-transfer mode in H5+. On the basis of these calculations, alternative assignments of the recently reported infrared multiphoton dissociation spectra of H5+ and D5+ [ J. Phys. Chem.

Reduced dimensional calculations of the spectra of H5+ and D5+ are used to provide an understanding of why such high overtones should be observable through absorption spectroscopy. Implications of how excitations of this mode can provide insights into the H3+ + H2 reaction are also discussed.},

abstract = {H 5 + is the smallest proton-bound dimer. As such, its potential energy surface and spectroscopy are highly complex, with extreme anharmonicity and vibrational state mixing; this system provides an important benchmark for modern theoretical methods. Unfortunately, previous measurements covered only the higher-frequency region of the infrared spectrum. Here, spectra for H 5 + and D 5 + are extended to the mid-and far-IR, where the fundamental of the proton stretch and its combinations with other low-frequency vibrations are expected. Ions in a supersonic molecular beam are mass-selected and studied with multiple-photon dissociation spectroscopy using the FELIX free electron laser. A transition at 379 cm −1 is assigned tentatively to the fundamental of the proton stretch of H 5 + , and bands throughout the 300−2200 cm −1 region are assigned to combinations of this mode with bending and torsional vibrations. Coupled vibrational calculations, using ab initio potential and dipole moment surfaces, account for the highly anharmonic nature of these complexes. SECTION: Spectroscopy, Photochemistry, and Excited States S mall hydrogen ions and their clusters have been seen for many years in plasma and mass spectrometry environments. 1−3 These fascinating ions are also believed to be present in interstellar gas clouds, playing a vital role in the chemistry at low temperature. 4−7 H 3 + was first observed over 100 years ago by J. J. Thomson in hydrogen discharges. 8 Since then, this ion has been studied extensively because of the low proton affinity of H 2 and the consequent tendency of H 3 + to undergo proton-transfer reactions. 9−18 Larger protonated hydrogen clusters such as H 5 + were also observed, and their chemistry has also been documented. 19−21 The laboratory infrared spectrum of H 3 + was reported by Oka and co-workers, 22,23 and subsequently this ion was identified in numerous interstellar sources. 24−27 H 5 + is the intermediate in the symmetric proton transfer from H 3 + to H 2 , and its deuterated analogues are proposed as intermediates in deuterium fractionation reactions in the interstellar medium. 15−17,26,27 After much computational study, H 5 + , in its ground vibrational state, is recognized as a symmetric (D 2d) proton-bound dimer. 28−44 Its potential has a double minimum with limiting H 3 + −H 2 structures, but the maximum of the zero-point density is located at the D 2d first-order saddle point, giving rise to a symmetric structure with an equally shared proton. Okumura, Yeh, and Lee (OYL) reported the first IR spectroscopy for H 5 + in the 3500−4000 cm −1 region, 45,46 but assignment of the bands was complicated by the extreme anharmonicity of the system. More recently, Cheng et al. used more efficient ion cooling and broader IR laser tuning (2000−4500 cm −1) to obtain improved data for H 5 + and the first spectra for D 5 +. 47 These spectra were assigned in coordination with a full anharmonic potential and spectral analysis. In the present Letter, these latter measurements are extended for both H 5 + and D 5 + into the mid-and far-IR region using the expanded frequency coverage of the FELIX free electron laser. 48 The infrared spectrum of H 5 + measured by OYL used mass selection of the ion followed by laser photodissociation measurements, detecting the yield of H 3 + ions resulting from the elimination of H 2. 45,46 Three broad asymmetric bands in the 3450−4150 cm −1 region were assigned to vibrations involving shared-proton and terminal H 2 stretching motions. Our latest measurements used the expanded tuning range of new IR-OPO lasers to cover the 2000−4500 cm −1 region. 47 We detected the bands seen originally by OYL, as well as an additional feature at 2603 cm −1. Our spectra were the first for D 5 + , producing several bands in the 2500−3200 cm −1 region. 47 Using Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and vibrational configuration interaction [the "Reaction Path" version of the code MULTIMODE (MM-RPH)] calculations, the spectra for both H 5 + and D 5 + were assigned and found to be in good agreement with the predicted spectrum, corresponding to the D 2d symmetry structure. 47},

abstract = {Two methods for studying the rotation/torsion coupling in H5(+) are described. The first involves a fixed-node treatment in which the nodal surfaces are obtained from a reduced dimensional calculation in which only the rotations of the outer H2 groups are considered. In the second, the torsion and rotation dependence of the wave function is described in state space, and the other internal coordinates are described in configuration space. Such treatments are necessary for molecules, like H5(+), where there is a very low-energy barrier to internal rotation. The results of the two approaches are found to be in good agreement with previously reported energies for J = 0. The diffusion Monte Carlo treatment allows us to extend the calculations to low J, and results are reported for the three lowest energy torsion excited states with J ≤ 3. For the level of rotational and vibrational excitation investigated, only modest changes in the vibrational wave functions are found. The effects of deuteration are also investigated, focusing on D5(+) and the symmetric variants of H4D(+) and HD4(+).},
