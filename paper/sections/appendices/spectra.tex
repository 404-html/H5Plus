The use of adiabatic surfaces adds a layer of complication onto our basic intensity equations. Our wavefunctions in the adiabatic approximation are given by Equation \refeq{adiabatic_wfns}. This mean that our oscillator strength will be given by \refeq{couple_spec_osc}.

\loadeq{couple_spec_osc}

Since our $\phi^{\mhtwo}$ and $\psi^{\mhplus}$ operate over different coordinates we can separate each of these integrals as shown in Equation \refeq{couple_spec_osc_sep}.

We can then replace all the terms in $r_1$ and $r_2$ with an effective dipole moment in $a$ and $s$ for each surface as given in \refeq{spec_tmoment}. A sample of these surfaces is plotted in \reffig{dipole_surfaces}. This reduces \refeq{couple_spec_osc} to an expansion in terms looking like \refeq{spec_osc}.
