\COM{Because we see experimental and theoretical signatures of predominantly shared \hplus{} and outer \htwo{} motions in the spectra}
Taking these four coordinates, we construct our Hamiltonian in terms of the stretches of the \htwo{}s and of the shared \hplus{}. We focus on the $C_{2v}$ equilibrium geometry and $D_{2d}$ vibrationally averaged geometry in our calculation. The $D_{2d}$ structure and overlaid coordinate system is shown in \reffig{h5geom}. The Hamiltonian we are using in these coordinates is given in \refeq{baseHam}.

We then symmetrize our $R_1$ and $R_2$ coordinates by the transformations in \refeq{symm}.

This then decouples our shared proton coordinates, giving us our working Hamiltonian, which is \refeq{hamm}.

In this $\mu_{a}$ and $\mu_{s}$ are the effective reduced masses of the symmetrized stretches and $\mu_{r_1}$ and $\mu_{r_2}$ are those of a basic \htwo{} stretch. The expressions for these in terms of the mass of hydrogen $m_{\mathrm{H}}$ are given in \refeq{masses}.

The potential $V(a, s, r_1, r_2)$ is constructed by using the Gaussian 09 software package and performing electronic structure calculations on a regular grid in the four coordinates at the aug-cc-PVDZ level of theory.
