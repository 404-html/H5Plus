To compute these ground states we use a technique known as \textit{discrete variable representation} (DVR), which has been demonstrated to be highly effective at solving the time-independent Schr{\"o}odinger equation for complicated phenomena in small numbers of dimensions~\cite{Light2007}. The concepts behind DVR are discussed in more detail by Light and coworkers~\cite{Light2007} and in \refapp{dvr}. We use the DVR formulation of Colbert and Miller~\cite{Colbert1992} with a direct-product extension to higher dimensions. This specific formulation of DVR is chosen as it provides simple analytic expressions for everything we need to work with. Since our \hplus{} and \htwo{} Hamiltonians have the same general form but with different masses and different potentials we use the same 2D direct-product Colbert and Miller DVR for both with the appropriate substitutions.\TODO{This is a bit short and would it be good to have more discussion of what this entails here}
