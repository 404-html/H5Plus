\hfive{}, having five atoms, has nine vibrational modes. We focus on those modes built from the coordinates shown in \reffig{h5geom}\COM{not quite right, but not worth fixing}. In our model, there are two coordinates describing the position of the shared \hplus{} and two for stretches in the \htwo{}s. We justify this choice of coordinates by considering that prior work in our group and others studying \hfive{} with discrete variable representation~\cite{Lin2012}~\cite{Lin2015} and diffusion Monte Carlo~\cite{Lin2013}~\cite{Lin2015}~\cite{Marlett2015} has found that the most intense transitions could be characterized as excitations of the shared \hplus{} modes and the  \htwo{} modes. Harmonic calculations using the Gaussian 09 program\cite{Gaussian09} also suggest that the bending motions that comprise the five unaccounted for bending vibrations carry little to no oscillator strength.
