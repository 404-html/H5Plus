In general, the intensity of a transition is proportional the oscillator strength of the transition and the frequency associated with the transition. The basic form of this is given in \refeq{spec_eqs}.

The oscillator strength is given in \refeq{spec_osc}.

For our particular case, since we solved our problem under an adiabatic approximation we introduce a mild complication to our equations. The details of this are worked out in \refapp{spectra} but analogously to the effective potential energy surfaces for the \hplus{} motion we generate effective dipole surfaces for the \hplus{} transitions. A sample of these surfaces are plotted in \reffig{dipole_surfaces}.

The symmetry of these functions reflects the symmetry of adiabatic state. The ground adiabatic state is symmetric about $a$ and thus the effective dipole surface is asymmetric about $a$. The same holds for the third adiabatic state while the opposite is the case for the second.
