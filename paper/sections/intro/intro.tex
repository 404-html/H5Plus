\hfive{} is an astronomically relevant species.\TODO{Its discovery was complicated and we'll paraphrase here} Given that the interstellar medium is \squigg$92.1\%$ hydrogen~\cite{Anders1982}, the chemistry of hydrogen will have a distinct signature in astronomical spectra. \hfive{} fits into this picture as the product of the reaction $\mhtwo + \mhthree \rightleftharpoons \mhfive$ where the binding energy between the two components is on the order of $2600$ \wavenumbers{}\CITE{cheng...?}. This yields two equivalent $C_{2v}$ ground state geometries with two flanking \htwo{} groups which we will be calling the ``outer \htwo{}s'' and a \hplus{} shared between them. There are $128$ equivalent, accessible, minima on the \hfive{} potential energy surface. The richness of this potential energy landscape would appear to pose difficulties in studying \hfive{}, but prior research and spectroscopic patterns suggest a possible reduced dimensional approach.
