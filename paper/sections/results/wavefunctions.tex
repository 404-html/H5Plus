We have calculated \hplus{} wavefunctions over our coupled adiabatic surfaces. These may then be projected onto each adiabatic state individually. An example of one of these projections is shown in Figure \reffig{wavefunctions_sample} and the full set of wavefunctions that carry significant intensity is shown in figures \reffig{wavefunctions_grid_1} and \reffig{wavefunctions_grid_2}. What is noteworthy is how the symmetry of the projection of the wavefunction we obtain depends on the symmetry of the \htwo{} state it is projected onto. The overall symmetry of the wavefunction is determined both by the symmetry of the \htwo{} state and that of the \hplus{} projection, so for the totally symmetric states the projection onto the anti-symmetric \htwo{} state is antisymmetric. For the antisymmetric states the condition is the opposite.
