From our wavefunctions we have also determined which \hplus{} and \htwos{} states contribute to the most intense peaks in the spectrum. Previous work has found the \hfive{} supports an abnormally high progression of excitations in the \hplus{} motion with significant transition intensity. Our findings further support this. The dominant \hplus{} state for each projection of our wavefunctions along with its intensity has been tabulated in \reftab{state_contribs}. We find that states with significant intensity progress as far out as \squigg$9$ quanta of excitation in the \hplus{} mode of each projection. This is in line with the \squigg$9$ quanta of excitation found in the \hplus{} mode with no quanta in \htwo{} modes by Lin et al.~\cite{Lin2012} and has similar physical implications for the $\mhtwo + \mhthree \rightleftharpoons \mhfive$ reaction\COM{should I discuss these...Anne and Zhou discussed them at reasonable length in their 2012 paper...?}, although now over a base excitation in the \htwo{}s rather than being purely in the \hplus{} motion.
