    Figure \ref{fig:zhou_comp} but with a uniform Gaussian broadening of $50$ \wavenumbers{}. As described by Cheng et al.\cite{Cheng2012} the peaks in the experimental spectrum from \squigg$350-2000$ \wavenumbers{} come from a multi-photon absorption process and hence the intensities of those transitions do not necessarily correspond to the intensity of the single photon absorption process that we are modeling. This likely explains the deviation between theoretical and experimental intensities over this range of the spectrum. More detail is found in Figures \ref{fig:spec_chunk_1}, \ref{fig:spec_chunk_2}, and \ref{fig:spec_chunk_3}.
