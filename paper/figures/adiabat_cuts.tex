    Slices through the adiabatic effective potential energy surfaces with the outer \htwo{}s equidistant from the shared \hplus{} for the six lowest energy outer \htwo{} wavefunctions. Note that the first and second surfaces (yellow and green) are very close in energy as are the next three (red, blue, and orange). This is shown larger in \reffig{adiabat_cuts_big}.
