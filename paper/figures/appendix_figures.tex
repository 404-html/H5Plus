    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\RootDirectory/figures/spec_chunk_1.pdf}
    \caption{
    Comparison of our results (red) with prior theoretical work out of our group~\cite{Lin2012} (blue) and priori experimental work~\cite{Cheng2012} (green). Note the general red shift of our results relative to prior theory. Owing to nature of the experiment the experimental intensities will not agree with our work, particularly at low energies, but the general pattern is good. The frequency blue shift relative to experiment, however, suggests a need to refine the grid of the calculation. \CHECK

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\RootDirectory/figures/spec_chunk_2.pdf}
    \caption{
    Comparison of our results (red) with prior theoretical work out of our group~\cite{Lin2012} (blue) and priori experimental work~\cite{Cheng2012} (green). The large peaks are where the \hplus{} progression building off a single quantum in the \htwo{} vibrations begins. Note the good agreement in pattern.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\RootDirectory/figures/spec_chunk_3.pdf}
    \caption{
    Comparison of our results (red) with unpublished experimental work out of the Duncan group (green). The general pattern is suggestive and the lack of intensity in transitions beyond $6000$ \wavenumbers{} indicates that we will need to introduce two quanta of \htwo{} excitation to reproduce these results.

Note that each state, when multiplied by its \htwo{} state, is antisymmetric and can thus carry intensity }
